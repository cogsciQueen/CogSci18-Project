# CogSci18-Project

1. In this project, I implemented an encryption algorithm called 'RSA' named after Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman who are the authors of the algorithm.


2. The program will ask the user to type a message that is written in English. Then the program will encrypt the message and produce the encryption supplemented by a PIN code. 


3. In order to decrypt the encrypted message, you'll need to provide the PIN code.


4. In order to use the email option, you'll need to have an active Google account with 'Allow less secure apps' property to 'ON'. You can do so by following this link https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

5. In order to get the program started, run 'run()' command in any cell in the notebook.
